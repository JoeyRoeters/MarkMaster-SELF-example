# SELF - Superior Elegant Lightweight Framework

SELF is a custom-built PHP framework designed from scratch to meet the stringent requirements of modern web development. Developed as part of a university project, SELF aims to provide a streamlined, secure, and efficient way to build web applications, adhering closely to PSR standards. The framework is been build accordingly to the specifications for the course, it's not build on a large scale, like symfony or laravel; it's basic.

## Background

As a capstone project for Web Technology II, we were tasked with creating a PHP backend frameworks.
